Factory method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Factory method design pattern is used when we have multiple subclasses of a superclass and based on the input, we want to return
the object of one of the subclasses.

Factory method design pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.
